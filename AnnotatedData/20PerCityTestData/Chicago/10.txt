A beautiful apartment steps from the Chicago River and the famous Theater District. The building is just a short walk to Millennium Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, public transportation, and Michigan Avenue / State Street shopping. The apartment community itself boasts views of the Chicago River, Lake Michigan, and many more iconic Chicago architectural sites. Residents can choose from many uniquely designed floor plans including studios, convertibles, one, and two bedrooms. Each apartment home offers bamboo hardwood flooring, custom cabinetry, in-unit laundry, and Whirlpool appliances. The apartments feature an open space concept that joins the kitchen and living areas together, offering ample room for entertaining. The bedrooms are lightly carpeted with plush Berber and our bathrooms offer oversized bathtubs as well as modern vessel sinks. The rooftop is a retreat-like getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city, with lounge chairs, an outdoor fireplace, stainless steel grills, a private hot tub, and an outdoor movie theater.
