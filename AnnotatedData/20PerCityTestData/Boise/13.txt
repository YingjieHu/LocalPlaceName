Rent our cool North End Condo for the summer. We spend our summer in North Idaho and want to rent it from May through the end of September. Available May 1st.
 
 Spacious living room with all-glass wall opening to a full length balcony with nice view and shady trees. We're on the third floor which gives the space a really nice secluded feel while still being in an urban neighborhood location.
 
 Amazing location across the street from the Boise Co-op, 4 blocks to down town, also easy walk to Hyde Park and close to the foothills. 
 
 One bedroom with queen size bed, full office. Rent includes free Wifi (Cable TV would be extra, we use Netflix, Amazon etc, also get many local channels without cable). 
 
 All new carpet, counter tops and kitchen appliances.
