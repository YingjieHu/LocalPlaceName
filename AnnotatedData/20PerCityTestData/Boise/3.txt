5th floor apartment with two large windows and walk-in closet, all utilities plus free WIFI and cable included with rent of $490/month
 
 The apartment is completely furnished. Each roommate has her own private bedroom and bathroom. The shared living area includes a deck, a television, and kitchen area with two full-size fridges and a dishwasher. There's a full-size washer and dryer in the apartment.
 
 The apartment building has a 24-hour gym, pool and spa. 
 
 I am also selling my parking pass, which gives you access to secure, covered parking for $100. No searching for on-street parking or worrying about parking tickets.
 
 Take over my lease at LaPointe apartments. The location is close to Boise State, Ann Morrison Park, and the greenbelt. It's within easy walking distance of downtown, including Trader Joe's, the Knitting Factory, restaurants, and shopping.
