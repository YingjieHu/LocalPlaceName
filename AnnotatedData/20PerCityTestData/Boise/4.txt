 This is a 1080 Sq. Ft., 2 Bedroom, 2 Bath, Apartment Home.


 Premier west downtown Boise waterfront property. On the banks of Quinn's Pond and adjacent to the Boise River Greenbelt, Boise River Park, Ester Simplot Park, and Idaho River Sports. Waterfront location and Renovated apartments available. Direct private access to the Greenbelt from property. Close to Elementary, Junior High, High School and Boise State University. Many top Boise employers just a 10 minute drive from the property.

If you want to stand out from the crowd, you go where the crowd never goes. You make your own path, you find your own tribe. This is where the journey begins. All those who wander are not lost. They live here.
We are the place where the restless rest, where people who like ot be outside can go inside. We believe that ana apartment complex should not be complex. It should be a community that feels like home, where people who celebrate Boise and love to play outdoors can live together.
