This completely furnished corner studio looks down on the corner of 8th Street and Front Street from the 8th Floor of the Aspen Lofts condo tower in Downtown Boise. The location can't be beat! It's close to all that downtown has to offer: Farmers markets, movies, bars, restaurants, shopping, BSU, the Boise River, the Greenbelt, the Capital, and so much more! The owners are going on an extended vacation, so the condo will be vacant and ready for occupancy from June 7-October 15th only. Because this is a short term, non-extendable lease, the owners are offering it for a VERY reasonable price of $1350.00 per month. The rental price includes all utilities and a parking pass for the attached parking garage. If you've been wondering what it's like to live downtown, NOW is the time to try it out! Come experience Summer in the City. $1350. security deposit, $35.00 application fee. Offered by SW Idaho Properties LLC.
