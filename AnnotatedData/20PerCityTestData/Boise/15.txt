Hey! I'm looking for one or two roommates around the middle to end of August. Preferably college students willing to share a town home/semi furnished apartment. Rent is a little over 450$ with utilities included. Free wifi & hot tub. Close to the green belt, next to BSU. It's a great location! Easy to get anywhere. I'm looking for friendly & CLEAN roommates.
