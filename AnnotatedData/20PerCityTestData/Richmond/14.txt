Hi There, 
 
 
 Looking for a young professional to take over the lease to my apartment from May 1st - May 31st. Can stay on if you like the place. 
 It is a sublease from May 1st to May 31st. Then a 12-month lease if you decided to sign a lease after my lease is up on the 31st of May. Then when my lease was up you'd need to find a new roommate as my current roommate is moving out at the end of the lease which is again May 31st. 
 
 You would pay me a $500 security deposit as you would be subleasing from me. 
 
 Your half of the rent is $500. It is a two bedroom apartment. 
 
 The utilities are usually between 100 - to 150 split between two people. So, each person either pays 100 or 150 depending on the season. The utilities for March were $200 so my roommate and I each paid $100.
 Yes! dogs are allowed. I do not recall there being a pet fee. 
 
 
 I am free Wednesday (4/12) or Friday (4/140) to show the place to you if you want to come by. 
 
 There are a washer and dryer in the unit. Off street parking / private entrance for the bedroom in the back. 
 
 
 The apartment is in a great location for hanging out in Carytown. 
 Close to CBB, NY Deli, DLB, and Sugar and Twine. The Bryd is right out the back door.
