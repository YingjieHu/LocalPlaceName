Subject: DARLING 4.5BR/2.5ba custom home/horse property in woods 1 m. from dt Sandpt ( <g1>Syringa Heights</g1> - Sandpoint)
 
 Lovely, 2,800 sf home (with 600 sf rustic detached 2 car carport) with chicken coop, hay barn on 2+ acres, (horse pasture optional) located a convenient 1.5 mile distance to <g2>downtown Sandpoint</g2> in the Washington school district. This comfy, <g3>North Idaho</g3> secluded, ranch-style dwelling is private and surrounded by tall cedar trees and lodgepole pines with a long driveway. The house is perfect for growing a small family or executive wanting seclusion and peace and quiet (yet still so close to downtown Sandpoint). Wrap around deck, wood stove, forced air heating, hardwood floors, glass block shower, full kitchen with island, plenty of light, cute and cozy. Nice big unfenced yard to have a large garden! 
 Heat is forced air heating and hot water heater as well as a wood stove to replace or supplement heat bill. House is on septic system so no sewer/water bill and well water. High speed Internet available (Northland Cable) and Direct TV available. Includes appliances and washer and dryer in downstairs laundry room.
 
 Daylight basement apartment has totally separate accommodations and private entrance. Although perfectly situated on 2 acres, this gem is through the woods and field behind <g4>Sandpoint West Athletic Club</g4> , near <g5>Traver's Park</g5> and the <g6>Waldorf School</g6> . Be in town but feel like you are in the woods with the 25 acres surrounding land/woods in <g7>Syringa Heights neighborhood</g7> about a 1/2 mile off the bike path and 6 miles from base of <g8>Schweitzer Mountain</g8> . The property is 2 separate floors with 2 completely separate entrances and kitchens. Perfect setup for 2 families, roommates or in-law quarters. 
 
 Top Floor (Complete Living Space) (1,400 sf): 1.5 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, full kitchen, wood stove, hardwood floors. Wrap around deck. $1,095/mo
 Bottom Floor (Complete Living Space) (1,400): 3 bedrooms, 1 bath: $1,095/month
 Take entire space for $1,995/month (pasture included for add'l $100/horse up to 4 horses)
 
 Utilities not included (shared utilities between top and bottom. WS runs $42/month. Electric: approx $39-$209/month pending season and wood stove supplement). Snowplowing is not included but perhpas a deal could be worked out with the neighbor at the end of the road.
 
 The downsides are that is near RR tracks (the train passes about 6 times in a 24 hour period..the whistle blows at the road crossing at the end of the long drive. Also, it might need some general gardening, and light maintenance (although everything is currently working). It does come with appliances including washer, dryer and dishwasher. The upstairs has room and hookups for a stackable although none is provided and the bedrooms are small. Other than that, the location, privacy, seclusion and flexibility of the layout is perfect for a home office/extended family (grandparent, nanny, inlaws, close friends, etc.) and overrides the downs as listed. 
 
 Some house pets are permitted with additional $300/pet damage deposit. 6 month lease minimum. Previous renters stayed for 6 years, and the couple before that stayed for almost 5.
