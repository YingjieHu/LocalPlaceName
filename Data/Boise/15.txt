Hey! I'm looking for one or two roommates around the middle to end of August. Preferably college students willing to share a town home/semi furnished apartment. Rent is a little over 450$ with utilities included. Free wifi & hot tub. Close to the <g1>green belt</g1> , next to <g2>BSU</g2> . It's a great location! Easy to get anywhere. I'm looking for friendly & CLEAN roommates.
