 The condo is in a vintage building that's really well kept and modernized but still retains the vintage charm. You would have 2 private bedrooms (second can be used as office), good living space, there is a washer dryer in the unit, dishwasher, hardwood floors, central heat & A/C. Enough room in the fridge for the chef in you with a nice kitchen, a nice bathroom as well. The 2nd bedroom has privacy blackout curtains on the french doors. The place is quiet for a great night's rest when you want to be a homebody.
 
 It's only a 3 minute walk to the <g9>Lawrence Red line</g9> ! If needed, there is free street parking also which is great for guests (easier to find on off peak times). With bike lanes all around, it's great for bikers too. Yes the is plenty of building storage for your bikes as well. There are all kinds of diverse food around and the <g10>Green Mill Jazz club</g10> is a minute away. If you want to explore other areas the lake is only 1 mile East, <g11>Andersonville</g11> is 1 mile Northwest, <g12>Wrigley Field</g12> is less than 2 miles South (quick ride on the redline).
 
 Me: Early 30s M former professional turned med student, I'm the owner of the condo. Had to move away & stay mobile to work on getting my MD, which is why I'm renting it out. I love this place so I and am looking for someone who will feel the same. This includes no smoking inside the unit, unfortunately not pets are allowed. If any issue should arise of if you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me.
 
 You: Someone who also appreciates this area and would want to keep the place clean. This place would be great for almost anyone whether you're by yourself, a couple or want to room with a friend. It's also great for medical students studying for boards, busy professionals, those working from home or if you just need a comfortable place in an awesome location.
 
 The lease would be for 14months preferably; we can discuss options to renew or terminate when we are closer to lease expiration.
 
 I would require a security deposit and a $50 credit/criminal background check fee per person living here. The association requires a move in and leasing fee totaling $500. Also would need proof of income or cosigner.
 
 Feel free to ask questions or schedule a time to see it!
